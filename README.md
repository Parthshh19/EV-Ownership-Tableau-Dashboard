## Objective

The intended objective for this dashboard is focused on understanding customer demographics, charging behaviour, and cost savings associated with EV ownership. 

### Key Questions

What are the demographics of EV owners?
What are the most sold type of electric vehicles in different regions?
How much cost savings do EV owners realize compared to traditional vehicle owners?
What is the motivation behind EV adoption in different households?
What are the typical charging behaviours of these owners?
Actions and Outcomes

### The dashboard will support in:

Identifying key customer segments based on demographics.
Understanding the most common charging patterns to improve charging technology.
Analysing cost savings to highlight the financial benefits of EV ownership in marketing campaigns.
Exploring regional variations to tailor marketing and sales strategies accordingly.
Analysing buying motivation across different households and ensuring vehicles in different segments focus on those needs.
Desired Feelings

The dashboard should evoke feelings of confidence and curiosity. It should be designed to be:

Professional: Clean and organized layout with clear labelling and legends.
Engaging: Interactive elements that invite Emma to explore different data dimensions.
Informative: Detailed yet concise information that provides actionable insights.
Empowering: Enable Emma to make data-driven decisions with ease and assurance.
By addressing these aspects, the dashboard will not only meet Emma’s informational needs but also foster a sense of mastery over the data, allowing her to drive GreenWheels Inc. toward greater success in the EV market.

## The Right Fit

The overall design uses a limited, consistent colour palette, with most features coloured according to EV Type and Number of EV Owners. The restrained use of colour ensures that data can be read at a glance, allowing inherent patterns to emerge clearly. Disparate colours make up the qualitative colour scheme, providing a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface. Fonts are also used consistently, with use of bold text to emphasize on the dashboard heading.

The geographical heatmap that initially draws the eye is used to the geographical distribution of the number of EV owners.. Other key charts are arranged on the dashboard to provide a balanced and visually appealing layout, highlighting important information. Individual visualisations include:

Most Owned Type of Electric Vehicles in Different Regions:
Tree Map: Highlights the most popular EV types (BEV, PHEV, FCEV) by region, with different colours representing the intensity indicating ownership volume.
Insurance cost Incurred and Savings by EV Owners across different EV Types:
Bar Chart: Shows overall insurance cost and savings by EV type, indicating which vehicle type offer the best monetary gain.
Motivation for EV Adoption in different households:
Stacked Bar Chart: Illustrates EV adoption rates across different household types, highlighting reasons for EV adoption for different types of households.
Typical Charging Behaviors:
Lollipop Chart: Displays the average number of charges per week at work, home, and other places showing charging behaviour.
Dashboard Design

Interactive Filters:
Filters for region are easily accessible by selecting the state on the map, allowing Emma to customize the view based on her specific interests.
User Interface:
Professional Layout: A clean and organized layout with a consistent color palette. Subtle colors for the background and vibrant colors for data points.
Informative Design: All charts are well-labeled with clear legends, titles, and axis labels. Concise summaries or annotations highlight key insights.
By adhering to these design principles and incorporating the suggested visualizations, the dashboard will not only meet Emma’s informational needs but also foster a sense of confidence and curiosity, enabling her to make informed, data-driven decisions for GreenWheels Inc.

## Story telling

### I. Charts and Rationale

The following charts were chosen to effectively communicate insights about the electric vehicle (EV) market to Emma, the product manager at GreenWheels Inc.:

Map: The map shows the number of EV owners by state. This gives Emma a quick overview of where EVs are most popular. The color of each state corresponds to the number of EV owners, with darker colors indicating more EV owners. This map is interactive, so Emma can click on a state to see more information about EV owners in that state.

Tree Map: The tree map shows the most popular types of EVs (BEV, PHEV, FCEV) by region. This helps Emma understand which types of EVs are most in demand in different parts of the country. The size and colour of each rectangle corresponds to the number of EV owners.

Bar Chart: The bar chart shows the insurance cost incurred and savings realized by EV owners across different EV types. This helps Emma see which type of EV offers the greatest financial benefit to owners. The bars are coloured differently to distinguish between different types of EV’s.

Stacked Bar Chart: The stacked bar chart shows the motivation for EV adoption across different households. This helps Emma determine what factors do different household types prioritize while purchasing an EVs. The colours of each motivation bar corresponds to the household types. This helps Emma determine the decision-making process of different household types when considering EVs. This empowers her to tailor marketing strategies and product development to better address the specific needs and priorities of each customer segment.

Lollipop Chart: The lollipop chart displays the average number of charges per week at work, home, and other places. This helps Emma understand how EV owners typically charge their vehicles and make decisions on the charging technologies used in the upcoming products.

### II. Color Usage

Limited, Consistent Palette: A limited color scheme is used throughout the dashboard, with colors assigned to different EV categories (BEV, PHEV, FCEV) for easy identification. This consistency allows viewers to focus on data patterns without being overwhelmed by color variations.
Muted Tones: Muted tones are used for the background and chart elements to avoid distracting from the data itself. This maintains a professional and data-focused aesthetic

### III. Hierarchical Approach

A hierarchical approach is implemented to guide users through the data exploration:

Top-Level Overview: Key metrics like the number of EV owners by state are placed prominently at the top to provide a quick high-level view.
Deeper Dives: Interactive filters allow users to explore these metrics in more detail. For example, users can filter by region to see the breakdown of EV types. This hierarchical structure encourages users to investigate further based on their initial interests.

### IV. Interactive Components

Interactive filters are incorporated throughout the dashboard to empower Emma to conduct her own analysis:

Regional EV Type Filters: Users can filter data by regions (Metro, Regional) and EV Type to see variations in EV adoption and usage patterns.
Geographical Filters: Users can filter data by State to compare the performance of EV’s in different states

### V. Supporting the Objective

Customer Segmentation: Bar charts showing key criteria like household type and motivation can help Emma identify key customer segments for targeted marketing efforts as well as the factors determining an EV purchase. This can hep them tailor their product offering to meet the customer demands.
Charging Technology Development: Understanding charging behaviors through charts and filters can inform decisions about charging technology development. This can help determine the preferred medium for charging vehicles so that they can equip all cars with the same technology as a priority.
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Highlighting cost savings with bar charts allows Emma to emphasize the financial advantages of EV ownership in marketing campaigns. It can also help determine what type of EV is the most cost efficient.
Tailored Strategies: Interactive filters enable Emma to explore data by region and demographic, allowing for the development of customized marketing and sales strategies for different areas.

### VI. Data Sources and Manipulation

Data Source: The specific data source could be market research data or customer survey information collected by the company.
Data Manipulation: The data is complete with no missing information.

Overall, the dashboard is designed to be informative, engaging, and easy to use. The different charts and graphs are well-labeled and easy to understand, and the dashboard is interactive, so Emma can explore the data in more detail. This dashboard should help Emma make data-driven decisions about future product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer support services for GreenWheels Inc.
